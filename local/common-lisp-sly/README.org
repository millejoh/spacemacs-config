* Description
This layer provides support for Common Lisp to Spacemacs using Sly. This layer should be used
instead of the =common-lisp= layer if you want to use Sly -- a more featureful Common Lisp
environment.

** Features
- Syntax highlighting
- Fuzzy auto-completion using =company=
- REPL and introspection support via [[https://github.com/joaotavora/sly][Sly]]
- Support for specific Lisp navigation styles via =common-lisp-mode=
- Support for the [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]] backend or any other Common Lisp implementation
- Ability to save a layout with a REPL and have it restored the next time that layout is loaded
- Multiple REPL connections for the same or different Common Lisp images
- REPLs have full ANSI color code support via [[https://github.com/PuercoPop/sly-repl-ansi-color][sly-repl-ansi-color]]
- Stickers, a more advanced, non-intrusive alternative to print debugging, and a means for live code
  annotation.

* Layer Installation
If you have previously installed SLIME in any other way, it is recommended that you uninstall it
before proceeding. You should clean up any configuration files tied to SLIME that are left behind as
well.

To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to add =common-lisp-sly=
to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file.

This layer defaults to using [[http://www.sbcl.org/][SBCL]]. If you want to use a different implementation of Common Lisp, you
can specify it in your =~/.spacemacs=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun dotspacemacs/user-config ()
    (setq inferior-lisp-program "/path/to/your/lisp"))
#+END_SRC

* Structurally Safe Editing
This layer adds support for =evil-cleverparens= which allows safe editing of lisp code by keeping the
s-expressions balanced.

By default this mode is not activated. You can turn it on locally on the active buffer with ~SPC m T
s~ (=s= for safe).

To turn it on automatically for all =common-lisp= buffers call the following function in your
=dotspacemacs/user-config= function:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(spacemacs/toggle-evil-safe-lisp-structural-editing-on-register-hook-common-lisp-mode)
#+END_SRC

or to enable it for all supported modes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(spacemacs/toggle-evil-safe-lisp-structural-editing-on-register-hooks)
#+END_SRC

When enabled, the symbol =ðŸ†‚= should be displayed in the mode line.

* Key Bindings
** Working with Lisp files (slurpage, barfage, and more)
Spacemacs comes with a special =lisp-state= for working with Lisp code that supports slurpage, barfage
and more tools you'll likely want when working with Lisp.

As this state works the same for all files, the documentation is in global [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/DOCUMENTATION.org#lisp-key-bindings][DOCUMENTATION.org]]. In
general, use ~SPC k~ to interact with =lisp-state=.
